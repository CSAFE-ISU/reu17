### Section 5.7: Hair Analysis

First off, any experiment done with hair analysis would need a very large sample size. I would gather 10 hair samples from 150 random people across the country, for a total of 1500 hair samples. These samples would be put into a database for 5 examiners to work from as well as the actual hair being available for examination. These 5 examiners would need to be from different forensic labs to test the different methods they might use for the analysis. The examiners would be the treatment for this experiment and the individual hairs would be the units.

There would also be an additional 10 hairs taken from 5 random people that will not match any samples in the database. Every examiner would need to analyze every sample to eliminate bias and ensure that every examiner is exposed to the same samples. The responses would be an examiner declaring a hair to be a match or not a match. The randomness would come from the hairs coming from a multitude of people from across the country. These people would most likely treat their hair differently from one another leading to hairs with different characteristics. The replication comes from the 5 examiners needing to analyze every hair by themselves.
