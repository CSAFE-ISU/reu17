## Bitemarks: 5.3

- What kind of factors would you need to control for, and how would you accomplish that?  The factors that would be controlled are the length of time between when the bite was taken and when it was examined. Another control would be the surfaces that where the bitemark is being made. 


- What would be the treatments in your experiment? The treatment would be the comparison of marks from where their made, and dental records


- What would the units be? The units would be the different surfaces that the bitemarks are being made on. For example, surfaces like skin or a wax paper.


- What would the responses be? How would you measure those responses? The responses would be yes a match, no a match, or inconclusive. 


- How would you utilize randomness within your experiment? To produce randomness examining the bitemarks collected in a random order instead of 1,2,3...


- How would you achieve replication in your experiment? Replication could be done by getting different analysist to examine the bitemark and see what responses would be made.
