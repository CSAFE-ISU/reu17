## Background:

Watch the entire CSAFE webinar (including questions at the end) posted [here](http://forensicstats.org/portfolio-posts/statistical-and-algorithmic-approaches-to-matching-bullets/). (The actual presentation starts about 7 minutes in.) While you are watching, keep in mind the following questions to respond to when you're finished:

1. What data do Hare *et al* use? 
2. In what ways do the methods used by Hare *et al* differ from the "traditional" methods of bullet matching? 
3. How do Hare *et al* use **clustering** to help perform bullet matching tasks? 
4. Identify one statistics and/or probability concept in the presentation that you have not heard of before. Do a little bit of research (Googling/Wikipedia is ok) and try to describe it to someone who doesn't know about it. You should also consult [this paper](bulletmatchingpaper.pdf) to see if there is more detail on your chosen topic than is presented in the webinar. (Hint: Control + F is useful...) You **don't need** to read the whole paper.

Respond to all of these questions in a blog post. Remember, length of response is not as important as how well and how clearly you communicate your well-formed thoughts in the response. Please avoid run-on sentences. The format of the response is up to you: try to put your personal twist on it! This is the last assignment we have for you. Make it your best one yet!
